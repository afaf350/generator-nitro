# Nitro App

Nitro is a Node.js application for simple and complex frontend development with a tiny footprint.  
It provides a proven but flexible structure to develop your frontend code, even in a large team.  
Keep track of your code with a modularized frontend. This app and the suggested
[atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/)
concepts could help.  
Nitro is simple, fast and flexible. It works on macOS, Windows and Linux. Use this app for all your frontend work.

## Usage

Before using, you need of course [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  
Nitro and the Nitro generator are tested with the current 
["Active LTS" versions of node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) (release 8.x).
